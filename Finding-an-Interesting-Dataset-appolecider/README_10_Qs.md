What is the standard deviation of the motor speed?
Create a histogram for it^
Which parts of the stator heat up more?
Does motor speed correlate to higher torque?
Do lower temperatures of coolant keep the whole stator cooler?
Which part of the stator heats up the most?
What is the relationship between the coolant temperature and each part of the stator's temperature? (dot plot would probably be needed)
What is the range of each component of the dp-coordinates?
